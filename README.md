# haikus-from-wikipedia
This is a small program that scrapes random Wikipedia articles and tweets 17-ish syllables in the form of a haiku. This code is deployed on Heroku and is scheduled to run periodically with a free dyno. My hope is that based on the "monkeys with typewriters" principle, this bot will occasionally entertain...or maybe even produce something kinda deep!

You can find the results here:
