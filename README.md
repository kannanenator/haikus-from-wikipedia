# haikus-from-wikipedia
This is a small program that scrapes random Wikipedia articles and tweets 17-ish syllables in the form of a haiku. This code is deployed on Heroku and is scheduled to run periodically with a free dyno. My hope is that--based on the "monkeys with typewriters" principle--it will occasionally entertain in the form of a witty non-sequitur, or maybe even something of deep meaning!

You can find the results here:
